## TODO: Add composition API and remove use of options
### Notes:

- The composition API is reusable and modularised; proving to be much more organisable and better performing.
- The options has issues with scalability - leading to issues with maintaining code.
- The options API isn't the best-use case for working with Typescript - which is what I aim to use once I've learnt the fundementals of Vue.
